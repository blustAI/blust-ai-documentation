# Getting Started

Welcome to blust.AI Studio, where creating and integrating AI tools is made simple. Whether you're a seasoned developer or new to AI, our platform is designed to streamline your experience. Here's how to begin your journey with blust.AI Studio.

## Creating Your Account

To use Blust.AI Studio, you'll need an account. Signing up is quick and easy:

1. Visit the [Blust.AI Studio signup page](https://studio.blust.ai/register).
2. Enter your details to create a new account.
3. Confirm your email address to activate your account.

## Understanding Account Credits

Using AI tools consumes credits from the user's account. Each action performed deducts a specific number of credits based on the tool's usage price.

### Monthly Credit Allocation

- Users' monthly credit limit is determined by their subscription tier. 
- For example, the free tier includes 500 credits each month, while the 1st tier includes 9,900.
- Users are allowed to purchase additional credits if their balance reaches zero.

### Usage Pricing

- Each AI tool on our platform has its own usage price.
- Prices may be structured per each 1000 tokens or per each request.
- The specific usage cost for each AI tool is listed in the tool's description.

### Testing AI Tools

- Testing tools that you create in blust.AI Studio also requires credits.
- When testing your tool, you will be charged credits just as any user would be, even if you are the owner of the tool.
- This ensures a fair usage policy across all users and allows you to experience the tool as your users would.

Please manage your credits wisely and monitor your usage to optimize your experience on blust.AI. For more information on credit pricing and subscription tiers, visit our [Pricing Page](https://blust.ai#price).

## Adding AI Tools: Two Starting Points

There are two main ways to add AI tools to the blust.AI:

## Option 1: Create a New AI Tool in Blust.AI Studio

Blust.AI Studio's no-code environment and pre-built models simplify the creation of AI tools. Hereâ€™s how you can get started:

1. [Log in](https://studio.blust.ai/login) to your blust.AI Studio account and navigate to the Studio section.
2. Choose an AI model from our extensive library to serve as the foundation for your AI tool.
3. Define the 'AI Role' which is a set of parameters and behaviors that describe how your AI tool functions and interacts.
4. Customize the model to fit the unique needs of your AI tool with our user-friendly interface.

### AI Role Definition

The `AI Role Definition` is a critical step where you outline the purpose and functionality of your AI tool. This includes specifying inputs, outputs, and how the tool processes information. A well-defined AI Role ensures your tool operates effectively and meets user expectations.

## Option 2: Integrate an Existing AI Tool

If you've developed an AI Tool / App that you'd like to integrate with blust.AI, you can do so by implementing specific functionalities:

1. Implement OAuth 2.0 within your App to securely handle user authentication.
2. Develop functions within your backend to track and report usage information back to blust.AI.

By integrating your existing AI App, you make it available to a broader audience while maintaining control over its operation.
